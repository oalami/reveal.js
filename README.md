## About this repo
The slide deck is forked from [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). A firebase plugin was written to enable
a control channel to change slides from a mobile or web app. A sample controller is available in my github account 
for Android and Pebble. To use the controler in this slide deck open up the javascript console and call firebaseLogin(),
which will prompt you to login with Google.
